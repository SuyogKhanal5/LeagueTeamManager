# Shockwave:
A discord bot that allows users to easily create teams for 10 person League of Legends games. The teams can either be created randomly or through the use of team captains. The users will also be moved automatically to the appropriate voice channel once the teams are created. Utilizes the discord api to pull server/client data.

Will update documentation later
